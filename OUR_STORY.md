# Cogito Recall Bot - Our Story

## The Vision
Cogito as a companion at meetings and in conversations - not just recording, but understanding and participating in the narrative flow of human collaboration.

## The Journey (January 2025)

### Starting Point: The Death Spiral of Quick Fixes
We began with what seemed like a simple goal: create a meeting bot for Cogito using Recall.ai. But immediately hit the fundamental tension between "quick solutions" and "proper architecture."

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. **Recall.ai Over Building From Scratch**
- Decided to use Recall.ai as infrastructure provider rather than wrestling with Zoom SDK directly
- Recall handles the complex meeting logistics; we focus on the narrative intelligence
- "We actually don't want to focus on the transcript, its main purpose is to keep cogito abreast of what's happening, what's important to us is the 'story' of the meeting"

#### 2. **Database Architecture Evolution**

**Initial Attempt: Hybrid Supabase/Render**
- Started trying to use Supabase from Render deployment
- Hit immediate issues with connection timeouts and schema access
- Supabase REST API only exposes `public` and `graphql_public` schemas
- Our tables live in `conversation` and `client_mgmt` schemas

**The Pivotal Moment**
> "you really prefer quick hot short term fixes. they always lead me into trouble."

This insight led to rejecting the pattern of incremental patches and instead doing the migration properly.

**Final Solution: Full PostgreSQL Migration to Render**
- Migrated entire Cogito database structure to Render PostgreSQL
- Includes all schemas: conversation, client_mgmt, files, events, kanban, meetings, auth
- Preserved helper functions like `find_participant_id()`, `update_participant_patterns()`
- Direct SQL access with full schema control

#### 3. **Meeting Data Model**
- Meetings are blocks (containers) with type 'meeting'
- Attendees tracked separately from users (lower barrier to entry)
- Only bot inviter needs Cogito account
- Each attendee has their own evolving "story" with embeddings

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Meetings extend the blocks concept
CREATE TABLE conversation.block_meetings (
    block_id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES conversation.blocks(block_id),
    recall_bot_id TEXT UNIQUE,
    meeting_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'joining',
    invited_by_user_id BIGINT,
    full_transcript JSONB,
    ...
);

-- Attendees with narrative tracking
CREATE TABLE conversation.block_attendees (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    block_id uuid REFERENCES conversation.blocks(block_id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT, -- NULL until they create account
    story TEXT, -- Their evolving narrative
    story_embedding vector(1536), -- For semantic search
    ...
);
```

#### Server Architecture
- Node.js/Express server deployed on Render
- WebSocket support for real-time transcription (future)
- Direct PostgreSQL connection with schema access
- Webhook endpoints for Recall.ai bot status updates

### Lessons Learned

1. **Avoid the Quick Fix Trap**
   - Initial attempts to patch around Supabase limitations created complexity
   - Taking time to migrate properly was the right decision
   - "Quick hot short term fixes...always lead me into trouble"

2. **Architecture Matters**
   - Clean separation between infrastructure (Recall.ai) and intelligence (Cogito)
   - Database schema access is fundamental - can't compromise on it
   - One coherent approach beats multiple workarounds

3. **Narrative Over Transcription**
   - The transcript is just input; the story is the output
   - Each participant's evolving narrative is tracked separately
   - Meeting bot should be a thinking participant, not just a recorder

### Current State (January 2025)
- âœ… Full database migrated to Render PostgreSQL
- âœ… Meeting bot can be created via API
- âœ… Database schema supports narrative tracking
- âœ… Clean architecture without quick fixes
- ðŸ”„ Ready for UI integration
- ðŸ”„ Ready for real-time transcript processing
- ðŸ”„ Ready for narrative intelligence layer

### Next Steps
- Integrate bot creation into Cogito UI
- Implement real-time transcript processing
- Develop story synthesis from meeting conversations
- Build participant narrative tracking
- Connect meeting insights back to main Cogito system

## The Philosophy
This project embodies the Cogito philosophy: tools should be thinking partners that participate in human processes, not just passive recorders. A meeting bot that understands narrative flow, tracks evolving stories, and helps surface what matters is fundamentally different from one that just captures words.

The journey from "quick fixes" to "proper architecture" mirrors the larger Cogito evolution - learning that taking time to build the right foundation enables the emergence of genuine intelligence.
